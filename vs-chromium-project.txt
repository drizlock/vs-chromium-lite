[Properties]
# The RootDepth property moves the root of the project forward from the location of the project file based on the path used to locate it
# Example: If the solution is located at c:/myprojects/project1/project1.sln but vs-chromium-project.txt is located at
#  c:/myprojects/vs-chromium-project.txt, a RootDepth of 1 would load the project root path at c:/myprojects/project1/
# RootDepth = 1

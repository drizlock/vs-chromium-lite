# VsChromium Lite

VsChromium Lite is a Visual Studio Extension based off of the original
[VsChromium](https://github.com/chromium/vs-chromium) extension. It takes
the more general purpose extension developed for the [Chromium Project](http://www.chromium.org/)
and slims it down to focus on search features.

To quote the original project:
> Amongst other things, VsChromium offers full text search engine, a fast and
> scalable alternative to the built-in "Find in Files" feature that can provide
> search results in less than 0.1 seconds for 100,000+ files.
